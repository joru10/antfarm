# Antfarm

Multi-agent workflow pipelines on OpenClaw. Each workflow is a sequence of specialized agents (planner, developer, verifier, tester, reviewer) that execute autonomously via cron jobs polling a shared SQLite database.

All CLI commands run from `{baseDir}/../../` (the antfarm repo root):

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/antfarm && node dist/cli/cli.js <command>
```

## Workflows

| Workflow | Pipeline | Use for |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `feature-dev` | plan -> setup -> develop (stories) -> verify -> test -> PR -> review | New features, refactors |
| `bug-fix` | triage -> investigate -> setup -> fix -> verify -> PR | Bug reports with reproduction steps |
| `security-audit` | scan -> prioritize -> setup -> fix -> verify -> test -> PR | Codebase security review |

## Core Commands

```bash
# Install all workflows (creates agents + starts dashboard)
antfarm install

# Full uninstall (workflows, agents, crons, DB, dashboard)
antfarm uninstall [--force]

# Start a run
antfarm workflow run <workflow-id> "<detailed task with acceptance criteria>"

# Check a run
antfarm workflow status "<task or run-id prefix>"

# List all runs
antfarm workflow runs

# Resume a failed run from the failed step
antfarm workflow resume <run-id>

# View logs
antfarm logs [lines]

# Dashboard
antfarm dashboard [start] [--port N]
antfarm dashboard stop
```

## Before Starting a Run

The task string is the contract between you and the agents. A vague task produces bad results.

**Always include in the task string:**
1. What to build/fix (specific, not vague)
2. Key technical details and constraints
3. Acceptance criteria (checkboxes)

Get the user to confirm the plan and acceptance criteria before running.

## How It Works

- Agents have cron jobs (every 15 min, staggered) that poll for pending steps
- Each agent claims its step, does the work, marks it done, advancing the next step
- Context passes between steps via KEY: value pairs in agent output
- No central orchestrator — agents are autonomous

## Force-Triggering Agents

To skip the 15-min cron wait, use the `cron` tool with `action: "run"` and the agent's job ID. List crons to find them — they're named `antfarm/<workflow-id>/<agent-id>`.

## Workflow Management

```bash
# List available workflows
antfarm workflow list

# Install/uninstall individual workflows
antfarm workflow install <name>
antfarm workflow uninstall <name>
antfarm workflow uninstall --all [--force]
```

## Agent Step Operations (used by agent cron jobs, not typically manual)

```bash
antfarm step claim <agent-id>        # Claim pending step
antfarm step complete <step-id>      # Complete step (output from stdin)
antfarm step fail <step-id> <error>  # Fail step with retry
antfarm step stories <run-id>        # List stories for a run
```
